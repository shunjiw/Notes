### What is linear regression?

Linear regression is a linear approach to model the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variables. The expectation of Y given X is linear in the parameters. 	

### OLS (ordinary Least Squares)

Ordinary least square is a kind of methods to estimate the unknown parameters in linear regression. The OLS solution is the parameters which minimize the sum of squared error, which measures the average lack of fit.

The ordinary least square solution is the best linear unbiased estimator ‘BLUE’. However, there may exist a biased estimator with smaller MSE, which trades a little bias for a large reduction of variance.
